Then merge <code>dev</code> into <code>main</code>.</p>"},{"location":"user-guide/Notebook/","title":"Example notebook","text":"<p>First we import our packages</p> In\u00a0[1]: Copied! <pre>import numpy as np\n</pre> import numpy as np <p>Then we run some code</p> In\u00a0[2]: Copied! <pre>a = np.std([1, 2, 3])\nprint(a)\n</pre> a = np.std([1, 2, 3]) print(a) <pre>0.816496580927726\n</pre> In\u00a0[\u00a0]: Copied! <pre>\n</pre>"},{"location":"user-guide/getting-started/","title":"Getting started","text":"<p>To get started you should download the code and look at the API and look at the notebook.</p>"}]}
